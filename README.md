- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexKStein
- 👀 I love solving puzzles and learning new things, which is how I found myself entering the software development world! Outside of coding, I love cooking, dogs (mine and all the rest), great beer and spirits, baking, chocolate, live music, comedy, Star Wars, Lego, and gaming (rpgs & LoL).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning literally anything I can! I am excited to take my new skills and start a new career in the Tech world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, education and anything to make the world better.
- 📫 How to reach me... email: aksteinphoto@gmail.com || LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexkstein/
